= JavaScript State Machine Documentation

== Running the REST API
. Start the WildFly 27 standalone server
.. `WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh`


. Copy the link:admin_console_config.json[admin_console_config.json] file from the
javascript-state-machine repository to `WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/configuration/admin_console_config.json`
. Go to the root of the backend directory and deploy the application
.. `mvn package wildfly:deploy`
. Just to test the REST API is configured, try to access
http://localhost:8080/js-state-machine-api/rest/public[+++http://localhost:8080/js-state-machine-api/rest/public+++] and ensure that you’re receiving a 200 code
. Rest endpoints are now configured

== Running the Frontend Client

. Install NodeJS
. Navigate to the frontend directory, and run `npm install`
. Now run `npm start`, this should start and open a window with the web
application, if not, go to
http://localhost:3000/javascript-state-machine[+++http://localhost:3000/javascript-state-machine+++]
and you should see the login page
. Web App is now ready to use

NOTE: The current implementation of the REST API and the frontend client are hosted on two different domains/ports. This causes an issue as they are not on the same origin/are Cross Origin. This breaks the CORS policy and should be fixed in the future. For development purposes, this is not a big deal, and can be combatted https://mybrowseraddon.com/access-control-allow-origin.html[by using this extension as a workaround]

== How does it work

NOTE: {HOST} =
http://localhost:8080/js-state-machine-api/rest[+++http://localhost:8080/js-state-machine-api/rest+++]

. The structure of the configuration file looks like this

[source,json]
====
    {
        "DEFAULT": {
            "name": "Username",
            "type": "text"
        },
        "ashpan": [
            {
                "name": "password",
                "type": "password",
                "order": 1
            },
            {
                "name": "Multi Factor Code",
                "type": "mfa",
                "order": 2
            }
            ],
            "second_user":[
                {
                    "name": "health card version number",
                    "type": "text",
                    "order": 2
                },
                {
                    "name": "health card number",
                    "type": "number",
                    "order": 1
                }
        ]
    }
====
. *GET* \{HOST}/default/
.. The first thing that gets called is the “DEFAULT” key, this prompts the
web app to display the first input for users to enter, in most cases
this would be their username/email. The type field is used to configure
what inputs are permitted on the client form
. *GET* \{HOST}/username/\{username}/
.. From there, once a username is submitted, another API call is made with
the “DEFAULT input” as a parameter. This call will return an array of
inputs, this array can be of any size with a minimum of 1 (e.g. a
password prompt). Each object in the array contains the name of the
field, the type of input, and the order of the inputs so that it is
rendered correctly on the client.
. *POST* \{HOST}/login/\{username}
.. Once the client inputs have all been entered and the submit button is
clicked, the data can be sent to Elytron to be verified for login. It
will be submitted to the server as a JSON string of key pairs. The key
will be the field name and the value will be the user's inputted value.
